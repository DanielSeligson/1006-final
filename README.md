Final project (whooo!)

Doesn't it seem like the semester has lasted too long? I think we are all ready for summer!

I used the Flask app to create 3 pages, the home page, the 1006 page, and the courses page

each of those pages have their own html file in the template folder

the main page has my general info you wanted; my name, grade, major, and a photo of me.
  it also has a link to each of the other two pages, and a link to an external website.
  
the 1006 page has a couple lines describing each of the assignments, and also a link back to the main page

the courses page has says each of the courses i took this past semester, and my grade in each of them

Thanks for reading all of my READ_MEs this semseter! have a great summer!!
